I'm new here. I'm not broke, but don't have much either. I imagine a massive upside potential in automating music production. Here's my attempt to make it happen.

So far I just know this:

- ReaScript + Lua can do almost anything inside REAPER â€” even interact with file systems.
- You can trigger REAPER scripts from command line, meaning GitHub Actions or cron jobs could render beats.
- JSFX (Jesusonic effects) are a whole hidden world for custom synth/fx.
- There are community sample libraries with tagging (like from audiobro, splice dumps, etc).
- You can simulate Ableton's Session View in REAPER using regions + macros + JSFX toggles.
